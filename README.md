# FOVCubeMaker
Project calulates the fov from a given point and image describes the limits of the fov as coordinates forming an asymmetrical cube

to achieve this, we will utilize various mathematical formulas and algorithms. These include:

1. Transformation matrices for converting between different coordinate systems.
2. Trigonometric functions to calculate angles and distances.
3. Image processing techniques to extract relevant features and information from the image data.
4.
